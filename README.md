# Hartman E., Mahdavi S., Peptimetric  

This git repository contains the code and data for a research project conducted by Erik Hartman (bachelor in Biomedical Engineering) and Simon Mahdavi (bachelor in Biomedical Engineering) at Lunds University.


### Background
This project have the aim of creating a platform for researchers within proteomics and peptidomics to visualize and explore differences in datasets retrived from MS and MSMS. Peptimetric is implemented as a web application making it accessible through a web browser without the need for package or software-installations at https://peptimetric.herokuapp.com/. The application is hosted by the cloud application platform Heroku. The front end of the application is developed in Python 3.8.8 using the Dash library in combination with Bootstrap components.

### Example data 
The data used to illustrate the usage of Peptimetric was retrieved from a study by Van et al (Peptidomic Analysis of Urine from Youths with Early Type 1 Diabetes Reveals Novel Bioactivity of Uromodulin Peptides In Vitro, 2020).


### Results

Peptimetric is used to visualize and dynamically explore the difference between the peptidomes of groups of samples, and the git contains all the code necessary to recreate the application and running it on a local server.
