### Background
Peptimetric is a web app for visualizing and exploring differences in peptidomic datasets retrived from MS and MSMS. Peptimetric is souly written in Python and uses the Dash library from plotly for visualization. It is dependent on a local proteome database to fetch FASTA sequences.

### Example data 
The data used to illustrate the usage of Peptimetric was retrieved from a study by Van et al (Peptidomic Analysis of Urine from Youths with Early Type 1 Diabetes Reveals Novel Bioactivity of Uromodulin Peptides In Vitro, 2020). The data was searched using PEAKS Xpro 
and the resulting files are stored in the example-files directory.
